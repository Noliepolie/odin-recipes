    <h2>I love cookie butter! I was able to find a way to make cookie butter cookies. I could not find any recipe,
        so I am glad I can share this recipe with the world.
    </h2> 

    <p>You can find cookie butter at Trader Joe's; they also sell cookie cocoa butter. 
       You can also stuff the cookies with leftover cookie butter by putting 1/2 teaspoon portions of cookie butter on a cookie sheet, 
       freezing them for 30 minutes, and then rolling cookie dough around them!</p>
