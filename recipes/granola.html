    <h2>This is an easy recipe for super healthy homemade granola. A tasty mix of nuts, seeds, oats and 
        dried fruits with a hint of coconut and honey.</h2> 

    <p><strong>Coconut oil -</strong> coconut oil can be either solid or liquid. This depends on the temperature in the room you keep it in. 
        If your coconut oil is solid, melt it first and then measure ⅓ cup</p>

    <p>The baking time may vary slightly depending on your oven so keep an eye on it 
        when making it for the first time</p>
